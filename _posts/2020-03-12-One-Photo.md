blurb: I drove past one spot so many times I had to photograph it.

I tend to think photography lies on a spectrum between a having a very specific photo in mind (like product photographers) to a more general theme or idea (like street photographers). With a general idea of what to photograph you can just head out and [antagonize people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkIWW6vwrvM).

Most of the time, when I go out to take pictures I tend towards the looser, less planned end of the spectrum. I'll normally aim for some suburb or place and wander around taking pictures until I'm satisfied. Or bored. Or politely asked to leave. When travelling, I try to have my camera on hand the whole time and snap photos wherever I can. I think this sort of process helps me take better pictures.

There's only one photo I can think of that I specifically planned and executed.

A *Merging Traffic* sign, near Darling Harbour in Sydney, announces to drivers that their ramps are joining forces to form the start of the Western Distributor. I drive past this sign a lot. Enough that it's become **The Sign**. Normally I pass right below **The Sign**, and as you go underneath you can see the way the two ramps form a frame with nothing but beautiful blue sky in the background. Here's [the view](https://www.google.com/maps/@-33.8743004,151.2003353,3a,39y,260.03h,95.59t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRiw1A53IRV60NODc6FmEiw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) from road. **The Sign** is right in the middle - you can't miss it.

Look at those leading lines. The perspective. How the eye is drawn towards **The Sign**.
Every time I drove by I thought it'd make a nice picture, and it took me way too long to notice the walkway to the left of the road that also runs right underneath **The Sign**.

But once I did, it was on.

Once you know you *could* get the picture, it then becomes about *how* you can get the best version of that picture. You scope out how exactly to get to that walkway, and if you'd have to lean over the railing to get a good view. You wait for some sunny summer weather with a clear blue sky. You leave in the morning, when the sunlight points west, towards **The Sign**. You make sure your lens is wide enough to get everything in shot. You expose for the sky, and hope you can recover some detail from the shadows.

And finally, when everything falls in place, you get *the picture*:

My tendency to not plan for any particular picture is probably related to the fact that I'm also not being paid for any particular picture - I'm sure that I'd put a lot more time and thought if I was being asked to produce something very specific. Photography being so non-structured and exploratory is part of the point, for me. That being said, if conditions aren't great when I go out I'll sometimes come back for a second pass on a nicer day. I'm not above *some* preparation for a better photo.

On the day, I couldn't justify getting all the way out of the house for just one photo - my "wander around until I'm done" instinct was too strong. I ended up wandering around for a while, through Ultimo, the Powerhouse Museum ([RIP](https://maas.museum/powerhouse-museum/visiting-powerhouse-in-2020-2021/)), and the new developments around the Convention Center. Some of them are in the [Sydney gallery](/photos/sydney/). I couldn't top the picture of **The Sign**, though.
