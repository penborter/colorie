## Our Sixth Sense
We evaluate other people's mindstate using the same tools we use to evaluate our own mind. We make inferences about others' minds based on our own experience first, and then start trying to account for others'. Our evaluation of mindstates is our "sixth sense".

The **Lens Problem** is the assumption that everyone thinks the same, has the same info, and has had the same experiences as you. The cure for the Lens Problem is more knowledge - talking to other people with a broad range of backgrounds / experiences / knowledge.

We're not good mindreaders - asking for someone's perspective is more effective than taking it. It's better to get feedback from the most accurate model of someone's mind (their own) than one with less fidelity. However it's important to note that we don't have access to our true internal motivations, and the ostensible reasons might not be accurate. See also: [The Elephant in the Brain](Elephant-In-The-Brain) and [Alchemy](alchemy).

> Our ability to read the minds of others is one of our brain's greatest tools, absolutely essential for navigating our complicated social lives. The mistakes we can make engaging this ability are of two different kinds: failing to recognizing a mind in something that is actually mindless, such as a hurricane or a computer or random evolutionary processes in nature.

> The most natural consequence of the lens problem is assuming that others will interpret the world as you do, because you can't identify exactly how your own interpretation is being influenced by the lens you view it through. You can observe this consequence by simply asking people to report what other people believe, think, feel, or know, on topics ranging from the trivial to the critical.

> Recognising the limits of your sixth sense suggests a different approach to understanding the minds of others: trying harder to *get* another person's perspective instead of trying to *take* it.

> This experiment has its flaws, but it inspired decades of research that revealed a startling message - that there can be a significant disconnect between what people think about themselves and how they actually behave.

> Introspection is blind to construction. This does not mean that our introspective guesses are never accurate, just as you might guess the correct answer to a multiple choice question. It means that you should be skeptical about their accuracy.

## Psychological Distance
**Mindsense** is engaged by proximity - either physical or psychological (connection to your in-group). Failure to engage often leads to seeing people as non-human. The opposite framing is that psychological proximity can be used to engage people's mindsense and generate sympathy for other humans or even non-human objects. For example, robots whose movement speed is similar to humans' are seen as being more humanlike.

The behaviours of self-propelled agents are easily explained by the presence of a "mind", even if this is clearly not the case. Anthropomorphisation is a simple heuristic for explaining events as "behaviour".

> Much of the killing by U.S. soldiers now comes through the hands of drone pilots watching a screen from a trailer in Nevada, with their sixth sense almost completely disengaged.

> Nobody waves, but almost everybody waves back.

> At times we seem to be experts at anthropomorphizing the world, spotting humanlike minds all around us, even in places where no such mind actually exists.

> This means that that attributing a mind to a nonhuman agent is the inverse process of failing to attribute a mind to another person. Anthropormorphization and dehumanization are opposite sides of the same coin.

## Social Costs
We make inferences about others' minds also based on our own experience first, then start accounting for others'. Because we have so much experience being ourselves, we assume everyone else is as well-informed where in reality most people are strangers and don't know us at all.

People think less about you and are more forgiving than you think.

> Others, of course, know much less about you and therefore cannot notice all of your fine-grained details. They look at you with the broader lens of a novice, evaluating you in general and in comparison to other people.
