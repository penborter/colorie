   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi.
Welcome to my website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time coming, for me - not &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; specific site, but the idea of creating a space online for the things I want to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal for this site is for me to showcase some of my projects, photos, ideas, and practice (non-technical) writing. You can find out more about me personally on the &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had trouble in the past with getting personal projects completed to a deliverable, shareable level (a personal website being maybe &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; prime example). To that end, my goal for this year is to publish a project or post on this site fortnightly. Something every two weeks. It’s a low bar but I’ll find a way to trip over it. Hopefully a “deadline” will give me some incentive to actually polish things to a level where they can be understood and enjoyed by other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even this website still has kinks to be ironed out, and isn’t at a point where I feel like I can stop tinkering. Honestly, that point mightn’t exist. But it’s good enough for me, for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to get on with adding things to it, starting with some of my photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Ben&lt;/p&gt;
