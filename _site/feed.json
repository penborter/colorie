You can find out more about me personally on the about page.I’ve had trouble in the past with getting personal projects completed to a deliverable, shareable level (a personal website being maybe the prime example). To that end, my goal for this year is to publish a project or post on this site fortnightly. Something every two weeks. It’s a low bar but I’ll find a way to trip over it. Hopefully a “deadline” will give me some incentive to actually polish things to a level where they can be understood and enjoyed by other people.Even this website still has kinks to be ironed out, and isn’t at a point where I feel like I can stop tinkering. Honestly, that point mightn’t exist. But it’s good enough for me, for now.I’m going to get on with adding things to it, starting with some of my photography.- Ben",
