# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ben

I'm an consultant from Sydney, focusing on capital-intensive projects in transport, energy, and water.

This site is here to help me learn [Python]({{ site.base }}/tags#python), data analysis and [visualisation]({{ site.base }}/tags#viz), and [web development]({{ site.base }}/tags#dev) in public, as well as hosting my [photography]({{ site.base }}/photos) and [reading list]({{ site.base }}/books). 

See my new Jekyll theme [Stretch](https://stretch.penborter.com/) (which this site will be converted to shortly).

This site is a work in progress, so check back for updates!
I'm also other on places around the internet, normally as **penborter**:
