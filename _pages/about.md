# Hi, I'm Ben

I'm an engineer (chemical, not software) from Sydney. I graduated in 2018 with a double degree in Chemical Engineering and Finance, and I'm currently working as a consultant, focusing on transport, energy, and water.

This site aims to showcase my journey in learning [Python]({{ site.base }}/tags#python), web design, [development]({{ site.base }}/tags#dev), and [data visualisation]({{ site.base }}/tags#viz), as well as hosting my [photography]({{ site.base }}/photos) and [reading list]({{ site.base }}/books). There might be a few thoughts and interesting links tossed around, too. Ideally it'll act as a focal point for learning, practicing and improving some new skills, and finishing side projects regularly to keep driving my progress. [I've struggled]({{ site.base }}/2020/first-post) with [finishing side projects](https://macwright.org/2019/08/25/side-projects.html) before.

I've found that one of the best ways to learn is by explaining it for others. This is the basis of the [Feynman Technique](https://curiosity.com/topics/learn-anything-in-four-steps-with-the-feynman-technique-curiosity/) and also my reason for learning in public on this website. (Potentially) having an audience will make sure I make the explanations as simple and accurate as possible, and in turn will incentivise me to understand things fully along the way.

This site is a work in progress, so check back for updates!
