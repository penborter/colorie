# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ben

I'm an engineer (chemical, not software) from Sydney. Currently I'm working as a consultant, focusing on transport, energy, and water.

This site aims to showcase my journey in learning [Python]({{ site.base }}/tags#python), data analysis and [visualisation]({{ site.base }}/tags#viz), web design and [development]({{ site.base }}/tags#dev), as well as hosting my [photography]({{ site.base }}/photos) and [reading list]({{ site.base }}/books). There might be a few thoughts and interesting links tossed around, too. Ideally it'll act as a focal point for learning, practicing and improving some new skills, and as an end point / anchor for finishing side projects regularly to keep driving my progress.

This site is a work in progress, so check back for updates!
I'm also other on places around the internet, normally as @penborter.
