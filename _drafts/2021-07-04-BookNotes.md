## Highlight Players

I want to highlight four players who exist on different parts of the spectrum.

**Ben McLemore** is the 2020 Moreyball MVP and Moreyball All-Star Starter. With a Moreyball rate over over 96%, Ben also averaged the second-highest proportion of shots from 3-point range after Duncan Robinson, another 2020 Moreyball All-Star. McLemore was found money for the Rockets this season, with a great [comeback story](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/28422665/ben-mclemore-nba-lottery-pick-lost-way-road-back) from being waived by the Kings in 2019 all the way to filling the perfect role on the Rockets.
