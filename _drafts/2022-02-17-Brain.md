Any evolved mechanism is adapted to the environmental conditions in which it has evolved and may malfunction or produce nonfunctional effects in different conditions. Modern day life

Heuristics and biases are useful - the brain isn't wrong and taking shortcuts isn't incorrect given the evolutionary context of the brain

Modern-day life is very different to the environment our brain evolved for.

Taking shortcuts and efficient processing of information is an optimal strategy if you're operating on the edge - i.e. you're eating, sleeping, and resting just enough to survive. Our understanding of these biases can justify all of them in this context, and the point of each basically boils down to increasing the chances of replication (i.e. reproduction). But humans don't live in that context any more - a constantly increasing proportion of the population gets a surplus of eats, sleeps and rests any time they want. 

It is worth being aware of where the brain is taking shortcuts to be more efficient with energy / processing power, because there's no need to pinch pennies in the current context. It's more appropriate these days to make the most of the brain's processing power, and take the full cognitive journey rather than a shortcut 

These evolutionary optimisations can be used for good or evil by [[Compliance Professionals]], nudging people into making optimal choices or tricking people into harmful [[Dark Patterns]] . Also see brands leveraging the [[Habit Cycle]].
