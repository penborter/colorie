Here are some useful links about writing, especially relating to blogs and blog audiences - hopefully they're a useful reference for when you're feeling stuck or uninspired, or just think your writing could use some tuning up. I'll keep updating this post as I find useful links (within reason). I also need to write something about continuous blog post updates...

#### [Just Write](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/) - Sara Soueidan
> Start a blog and publish your writings there. Don’t think about whether or not people will like or read your articles — just give them a home and put them out there.

#### [Thoughts on Writing: What They Say](https://matthiasott.com/notes/thoughts-on-writing-what-they-say) - Matthias Ott
> Only by publishing your work and placing it out in the world and in front of other people it is truly complete.

#### [Writing, briefly](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) - Paul Graham
> Publish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas

#### [Making Your Writing Work Harder For You](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/content-marketing-strategy) - Patrick McKenzie
> "But publication dates often provide important context!" Horsepuckey. You can, and should, make the strategic decision that you'll primarily write things which retain their value.

#### [Why I Write](https://jamesclear.com/scale) - James Clear
> I started to see being a writer as a way of being a leader by taking a stand for the things I believed in, sharing my mission, and rallying the people who believed the same things I believed.

#### [More People Should Write](http://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write) - James Somers
> I suggest writing emails to your friends. Writing with an audience in mind makes the writing better, and writing to a friend means you won’t get hung up on how you sound. You’ll become closer, too, to whoever you share your thoughts with, and odds are you’ll draw the same thoughtfulness out of them.

#### [How Jeff Bezos Turned the Narrative into Amazon's Competitive Advantage](https://slab.com/blog/jeff-bezos-writing-management-strategy/)
> In mirroring and then addressing readers' concerns, Bezos makes the tone of his writing all the more calm and confident by showing that he knows the issue inside and out and can refute any doubts.

#### [Fuck Stats, Make Art](https://pjrvs.com/art) - Paul Jarvis
> Your genuine personality, draws people in. Writing to be liked or writing that follows a formula does not.
