Water NSW puts out [weekly water storage reports](https://www.waternsw.com.au/supply/Greater-Sydney/greater-sydneys-dam-levels/weekly-verified-storage-reports) every Thursday. The most recent report captured a record-breaking rainfall in the Greater Sydney area, breaking the water shortage that's been building since about 2017. 

As part of the weekly reports, Water NSW also publishes a graph of the historical total water storage levels in Greater Sydney. It tells a story or two.

The most recent rainfall is captured in the big spike on the far right of the graph. It's easily the biggest weekly inflow since the turn of the century. Potentially, the magnitude of inflow was helped by the dryness of the land, where it wasn't able to absorb the massive volume of water which all ran off to the lower ground, streams and rivers, and then into the dams.

The trouble with this graph is that it doesn't show rainfall exactly - only the amount of rain that ended up in dams around Sydney. Larger rainfall events that didn't end up as much in the dams are impossible to spot with this graph alone. 

You can see the effect of the Millenium Drought mitigation strategies on the graph. The Sydney Desalination Plant was opened in 2006, causing the jump in maximum (and 50%) water storage levels around that time. Other methods for accessing deeper levels in dams caused smaller jumps and falls along the way.

We should also still have questions about our response to water shortages in general in Sydney. It's normally only well into the low rainfall period that solutions start being pitched, and both in this most recent event and the Millenium Drought in the early 2000s we were bailed out by a fortunately-timed rainfall.

- Lucky we were bailed out
- What will be the status of planned mitigation strategies now that they're not urgently needed?
- What would happen in an even more severe dry period?
