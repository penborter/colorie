In general, the very best fiction is context-rich, and this is one reason why many people may not appreciate all of the literary classics.

I'm sure I can think up a better title for this.

It's a combination of our compulsion to package things into stories, and the power of feedback loops in learning.

Truth, seeing things as they really are. Eyes to see. 

This is low-stakes **legibility**.

The big mistake in this pattern of failure is projecting your subjective lack of comprehension onto the object you are looking at, as “irrationality.” We make this mistake because we are tempted by a desire for <em>legibility.</em>

In the article linked above [Venkatesh Rao](https://venkateshrao.com/) discusses how our need for legibility leads to patterns of failure across society. These failures come when we try to simplify parts of reality without understanding how that those parts (a complex, subtle system) really work.

I think that on a small scale, an individual scale, we can avoid this failure pattern by leaning into the complexity. More context, rather than simplification. 

## Bringing art to life


I went to the Matisse exhibit at the Art Gallery of NSW last month. I'm not a Matisse fan in particular; I could maybe point out one or two of his most famous pieces. The exhibit was laid out chronologically, and as you walked through the exhibit you stepped through Matisse's life and his artistic journey. The centrepiece of the exhibit, the giant collage *Sorrow of the King*, was so much more interesting given how different it was from his early work.

                      They're a bit
	like museum displays – the trouble with museums is that
	you often know that what you're seeing would be utterly
	fascinating if only you had eyes to truly see it. But you
	usually lack those eyes. You see something very mundane
	– dining implements or cups or whatever, and you know
	they must have played an important role in the life of some
	household, and perhaps of some craftsperson. You'd love to
	hear stories from all those people – how the items were
	made, how they were used in everyday life, and so on. But most
	of that context is lost to you.

For reference I'm lumping sports into "Art". I find watching the Winter Olympics interesting (normally; less so this year) because I get to understand a new sport. Go through the process of 


## Learning

And when people start learning something new, they perceive the world around them differently. If you start learning how to play the guitar, suddenly the guitar stands out in all the music you listen to. For example, throughout most of the history of movies, the audience didn't really understand what a craft editing was. Now, as more and more people have access to things like iMovie, they begin to understand the manipulative power of editing. Watching reality TV almost becomes like a game as you try to second-guess how the editor is trying to manipulate you.
