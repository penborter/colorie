Facts change over time.

Some change quickly, like the current Tesla stock price ($1,222 at the time of writing[^1]). Some don't change at all, like the number of sides on a triangle[^2]. Everything else moves at some rate in between.

As I was thinking about this, Morgan Housel [wrote an article](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/experts/) (better than this post) about similar ideas:

Not a day goes by that I don’t become more confident that the secret to business and investing is identifying the few things that never change and hold onto them for dear life, and identifying what evolves and be ready to adapt those views quickly.

Some facts change quickly, like the current Tesla Stock Price ($1,222 at the time of writing).
Some facts don't change: a triangle will always have three sides. 

Every fact has some rate of change between never and constant:
- Triangles have three sides (never changing)
- 
- Australia's population is about 25,000,000 (years, depending on the level of abstraction)
- Tesla's share price is $1,222 (changes by the millisecond, when the market is open)
- 

The relevant rate of change also depends on the fact's useful level of abstraction. In actuality Australia's exact population is constantly fluctuating as people die and are born, but firstly there's no way to measure than granularly, and secondly the utility of knowing the population of Australia doesn't come from knowing it down to the single person. 

When I was in school the population of Australia had passed 20 million but wasn't anywhere close to 25.
