Wired has started using Google autocomplete in interviews, letting celebrities answer "The Web's Most Searched Questions" about themselves. These autocomplete responses are possible related search terms, sourced from billions of similar searches. Instead of light entertainment, search autocomplete can be also leveraged to find alternates. **More introduction...**

For example, I'm looking for video conferencing software and my [stockbroker told me to invest in Zoom](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/sec-pauses-zoom-technologies-as-traders-confuse-it-with-zoom-video.html). But what if I want to explore other options? Google autocomplete can come to the rescue:

Type in what you're looking for with a "vs" afterwards and let autocomplete do the rest.  In the *About* page, Google notes that these are [predictions, not suggestions](https://blog.google/products/search/how-google-autocomplete-works-search/). 

They can't stop us using them as suggestions.

Software and hardware give similarly effective results. There's an optimal level of specificity, where brands are often too broad while more directed queries can be too constrained. However it works down to the level of specific product codes:

This is a pretty basic tip, I'll admit. Essentially it's just a shortcut to searching for "X alternatives". In my opinion, still useful in certain cases. Especially for when you're planning your next holiday in 2022.
