## Human Irrationality 

In [Alchemy](/books/alchemy), Rory Sutherland often returns to the point that reality is not as neat as we'd like it to be. It doesn't exactly fit our models. We have a need for logical (read: legible) models to explain everything. But somehow we end up with the issue the wrong way round: we argue that reality is not "rational" without considering the scenario where it's our understanding that's lacking. 

Structure increases legibility. Consistent <mark>rules and agreements between people</mark> mean less information has to be conveyed in a given message, [because of the implication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yUafzOXHPE).   

Alchemy covers on human-level irrationality, largely, focusing on the causes of poor "legibility" in

Sutherland argues that people are too unpredicable for us to be able to develop universal models of behaviour. Motivational honesty is impossible because we don't have access to our unconscious motivations. From his advertising background he believes that revealed preferences (what people actually pay for across different contexts) is a more honest reflection of what people want. 

It follows, then, that this lack of access to motivations makes it extremely difficult to develop justifications for people's behaviour.

## Legibility

Legibility typically how easy a text is to understand. How effectively the meaning is conveyed. Wikipedia refers to a reader decoding symbols. Humans have a strong desire to increase legibility, which makes sense: we are social creatures, social systems require good communication, which means efficient and unabiguous (legible) messages. 

We can generalise the idea of legibility even further, to describe decoding and understanding any signal, be it a symbol or a social system.

## Complex Systems

The article above describes a common failure mode in large-scale organisations, as detailed [Seeing Like a State](https://openlibrary.org/isbn/0300078153) by James C. Scott. It goes like this:

Venkatesh Rao also [wrote about legibility](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/) in the context of [Seeing Like a State](https://openlibrary.org/isbn/0300078153) by James C. Scott.

## Iatrogenesis

Iatrogensis occurs when someone who is trying to help instead causes harm. The term was first used in a medial context (bloodletting, adverse drug interactions, etc.)

> Many things such as society, economic activities and markets, and cultural behavior are apparently man-made but grow on their own to reach some kind of self-organization.
