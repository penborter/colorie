This post is the second in a pair about Moreyball - [the first](/posts/moreyball) relates to individual players' preferences in the past season. 

**Moreyball**: Daryl Morey's basketball philosophy in practice, favouring three-pointers and layups over midrange jumpers. Since the Rockets doubled down on the philosophy in about 2013, other teams have started to catch on and implement their own version of the system ([at the expense of the Rockets](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nearly-every-team-is-playing-like-the-rockets-and-thats-hurting-the-rockets/)).
