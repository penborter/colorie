## Background
Should bad FT% players brick the second free throw intentionally, aiming to get the rebound and end up with the ball in the middle of the lane? You would only have to get the rebound around XX% of the time for it to be more efficient than shooting, depending on how bad the player is.

## Examples
- Luka Doncic (Mavs) against the Knicks (27-01-2022)
- Steven Adams (Thunder) against the Rockets (23-04-2017)

## NBA API
We can use the Python package [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) to get the play-by-play data.

## Measuring Possessions

### How to end a possession
- - Made shot  
	- `EVENTMSGTYPE = 1`  
- Missed shot w/ opponent rebound:  
	- `EVENTMSGTYPE = 2` followed by  
	- `EVENTMSGTYPE = 4` with a different `PLAYER1_TEAM_ID`  
- Turnover  
	- `EVENTMSGTYPE = 5`  
- End of quarter  
	- `EVENTMSGTYPE = 13`  

### Possession efficiency
How to measure the efficiency of a possession once you know where the possession starts?  

- It also has to be compared to the average efficient of a free throw in the NBA, which I'm guessing is very high. You'd have to be awful at free throw shooting for this to make sense or out of time basically.  
- And maybe compared to a typical offensive rebound efficiency?  
- Measuring this as points per possession as "efficiency"  

### Free throw offensive rebounds
We're looking for the efficiency of possessions after there a last free throw (`EVENTMSGACTIONTYPE = 12`) is followed by a rebound (`EVENTMSGTYPE = 4`), both with the same `PLAYER1_ID`. 
After that we can dig down and look at clutch situations only (if there are enough examples...)
