## Highlight Players

I want to highlight four players who exist on different parts of the spectrum.

**Ben McLemore** is the 2020 Moreyball MVP and Moreyball All-Star Starter. With a Moreyball rate over over 96%, Ben also averaged the second-highest proportion of shots from 3-point range after Duncan Robinson, another 2020 Moreyball All-Star. McLemore was found money for the Rockets this season, with a great [comeback story](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/28422665/ben-mclemore-nba-lottery-pick-lost-way-road-back) from being waived by the Kings in 2019 all the way to filling the perfect role on the Rockets.

Rockets shooters like McLemore

can take advantage of their "microball" spacing, and the amount of defensive attention focused on Harden (and Westbrook), especially as they drive. When McLemore screens for Harden or Westbrook, the superstar ball handler typically draws the defense's attention allowing McLemore to pop for 3 or slip to rim for a layup. They also run a nice play with McLemore as the inbounder, cutting to the rim off a back screen set by Harden.
